# Pirate puzzle visualization

Note: I had this idea because I read the title of [this link](http://azundo.github.io/blog/using-d3-dot-js-to-brute-force-the-pirate-puzzle/). It looked interesting, so I thought I'd try it myself before seeing how it was done in d3. I'd say the d3 version is a lot smoother, though that's probably because I don't do things optimally with raphael, rather than because of an issue with raphael itself.
