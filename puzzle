 An old parchment has directions to a treasure chest buried in an island:

> There is an unmarked grave and two tall oak trees. Walk from the grave to the
> left tree, counting the number of steps. Upon reaching the left tree, turn
> left by 90 degrees and walk the same number of steps. Mark the point with a
> flag.  Return to the grave. Now, walk towards the right tree, counting the
> number of steps. Upon reaching the right tree, turn right by 90 degrees and
> walk the same number of steps. Mark this point with another flag. The
> treasure lies at the midpoint of the two flags. 

A party of sailors reached the island. They find a pair of tall oak trees
merrily swaying in the wind. However, the unmarked grave is nowhere to be
found. They are planning to dig up the entire island. It'll take a month. Can
they do any better?
